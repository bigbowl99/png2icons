echo "# PNG2Icons

PNG2Icons is a Python script that converts PNG images into ICO files of multiple resolutions (256x256, 128x128, 64x64, 32x32). This ensures your icons look sharp and appropriate across different platforms and applications.

## Features

- Select a PNG file through a graphical interface.
- Automatically generate ICO files at 256x256, 128x128, 64x64, and 32x32 resolutions.
- Saves the ICO files in the same directory as the original PNG with resolution-based filenames (e.g., `logo-256.ico`).

- Python 3.6+
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) library
